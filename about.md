Hi! I'm Dzul - it's short for Dzulqarnain, and depending on where you're from, it might be a mouthful to pronounce.

I'm a fullstack web developer based in Latvia. I work with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as back-end technologies like ASP.NET (C# MVC). I'm a Microsoft Certified Software Associate, and an EPiServer CMS Certified Developer.

I enjoy working with them as well as writing about them. I have found that sharing my knowledge further cements said knowledge into my own head. And since I'm rather forgetful at times, I need all the help I can get.

In my spare time, I enjoy computer gaming (I'm a huge fan of Battlefield and DotA 2), travelling, tinkering (I like to break stuff so I can put them back together), playing music (I play the drums), and blogging (when I have some spare time - which, when you're an avid gamer with three active kids, is pretty much non-existent).

I also enjoy meeting new people, especially those with similar interests, so don't hesitate to get in touch with me about anything.
