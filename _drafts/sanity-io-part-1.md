I have recently started working on a project that runs on Sanity.io. This is quite refreshing, because I've been meaning to try something new. Eight years on EPiServer CMS can get quite boring.

Sanity.io is a headless content management system (CMS), and there are many others like it - Contentful, Strapi, among others.

## Project overview

So, what do I need for my web project?

* Site settings
* Start page
* Site navigation
* Various page types

## The setup

Sanity.io uses JSON to declare content schemas, which it uses to determine how the content is presented in the authoring UI, as well as how they are stored.
