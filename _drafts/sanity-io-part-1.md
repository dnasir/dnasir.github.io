I have recently started working on a project that runs on Sanity.io. This is quite refreshing, because I've been meaning to try something new. Eight years on EPiServer CMS can get quite boring.

Sanity.io is a headless content management system (CMS), and there are many others like it - Contentful, Strapi, among others.
