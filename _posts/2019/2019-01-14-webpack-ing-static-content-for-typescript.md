Here's a quick one.

I've recently started cleaning up the code for one of my projects, and one of the things I did was introducing the [file-loader][0] plugin, and converting static content references throughout my codebase.

It was a pretty straightforward process for image URLs within my Vue files, but then I also have code that switches out the background image of elements based on specific conditions. This requires the static content URL to be imported into the code that handles the logic.

For example:

```typescript
// component class

get centerOverlayStyle() {
    let backgroundImage = null;

    if (this.inputMode === MapInputMode.PICKUP) backgroundImage = 'url(/public/static/pickup-icon.svg)';
    if (this.inputMode === MapInputMode.DROPOFF) backgroundImage = 'url(/public/static/dropoff-icon.svg)';

    return { backgroundImage };
}
```

In order for me to use the image files emitted by `file-loader`, I need to replace the image paths with the ones generated by the plugin.

According to the documentation, I can simply import the image file into my code, and assign it to a local variable, and use it whenever I need reference to the image URL anywhere in my code. `file-loader` would resolve the path, allowing my code to point to the correct URL.

```typescript
import pickupIcon from '@/static/pickup-icon.svg';
import dropoffIcon from '@/static/dropoff-icon.svg';
```

```typescript
// component class

get centerOverlayStyle() {
    let backgroundImage = null;

    if (this.inputMode === MapInputMode.PICKUP) backgroundImage = `url(${pickupIcon})`;
    if (this.inputMode === MapInputMode.DROPOFF) backgroundImage = `url(${dropoffIcon})`;

    return { backgroundImage };
}
```

Unfortunately, while this works for regular JavaScript, TypeScript sees this as a problem.

```console
Cannot find module '@/static/pickup-icon.svg'.
Cannot find module '@/static/dropoff-icon.svg'.
```

Fortunately, the solution is quite simple.

Add a type declaration file (`d.ts.`), and declare the image files you're planning to use in your project as a module.

```typescript
// images.d.ts

declare module '*.svg';
```

Et voil√†. Problem solved.
