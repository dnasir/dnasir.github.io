This is the next tutorial in my line of IIS Tutorials for work. Unfortunately, there's a large possibility the company might not use MySQL, and use MS SQL Server 2008 instead. Well, I've already installed MySQL on one of the virtual IIS servers, so here's how I did it just in case they decide to use MySQL for other projects.
<ol>
	<li>Download MySQL installer fromÂ [http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/){:target="_blank"}</li>
	<li>Run the installer.
<ul>
	<li>Select Custom Install and set the install path to something easy to remember/use (eg. c:mysql). This really does not matter because it's not that difficult to find where you installed MySQL anyway.</li>
	<li>Select the modules you require. This depends on what you need. Personally, I would just install everything.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Click Next until the installation is done. Leave Configure the MySQL Server now checked and go through the Detailed Configuration.</li>
	<li>Select Server Machine as server type, and Multifunctional Database usage. You can also set this according to your needs.</li>
	<li>Leave everything else on default until Windows Option, then check Include BIN directory in Windows Path.</li>
	<li>Set the root password, and click Finish.</li>
	<li>To set PHP5 to access MySQL server,
<ol>
	<li>Open the php.ini</li>
	<li>Uncomment the following;
<ul>
	<li>extension=php_mysqli.dll</li>
	<li>extension=php_mbstring.dll</li>
	<li>extension=php_mcrypt.dll</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Finally, Restart the IIS service to apply changes.</li>
</ol>
That's it. It's actually easier than the Linux people say it is, me included.

Til next time, wassalam.
