I've released the first version of my jQuery Tagz plugin. You can find it on my Github page via the link below:

<a href="https://github.com/dnasir/jquery-tagz" target="_blank">jQuery Tagz</a>

This plugin converts your standard HTML text input field into a tags list. The plugin will take care of the visuals and data. You form will only see a comma separated value in the input field.

The project is based on the <a href="https://github.com/xoxco/jQuery-Tags-Input" target="_blank">jQuery Tags Input plugin</a> project by XOXCO. I initially forked the project, but I realised that it was in need of some code clean-up and I wanted to add some additional features, so I decided to reconstruct and rewrite the whole plugin. So while the concept is the same, the code is mostly new.

Like all other plugins I've released on Github, this one's also released under the MIT license. So it's free to use and abuse, as long as you keep the copyright info intact.
